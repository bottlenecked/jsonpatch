# 0.11.0
- Removed module Jsonpatch.FlatMap because it is not necessary anymore and not the focus of the lib
- Reworked creating diff to create less unnecessary data and for more accurate patches
- Fixed adding values to empty lists (thanks https://github.com/webdeb)

# 0.10.0

- Made jsonpatch more Elixir-API-like by adding Jsonpatch.apply_patch! (which raise an exception) and changed Jsonpatch.apply_patch to return a tuple.
- Implemented escaping for '~' and '/'
- Allow usage of '-' for Add and Copy operation
- Fixed adding and copying values to array
- Improved error feedback of test operation
- Fixed: Replace operation adds error to target
- Cleaned code: Replaced strange constructs of Enum.with_index with Enum.fetch
